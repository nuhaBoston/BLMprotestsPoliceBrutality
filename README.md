# An Analysis of the relationship between BLM protests on police brutality stats 

In May 2020 the murder of George Floyd by a police officer sparked national outrage and protests.
The events brought national attention to the flaws in Americaâ€™s policing system; particularly excessive use of force which is often racially motivated.
We study the relationship between fatal police killings on a state level and socioeconomic predictors, as well as the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests.

## Collaborators

This project was a collaboration of Nuha F. github: https://github.com/nuhaBoston , Amy S. github: https://github.com/amystphn, Scott C., and Cookie P.  

## Description

We examined several predictors, i.e. BLM protests, Racial Composition, Policing per capita spending, average crime rate, Political Affiliation (Republican/Democrat), Population Density, Household Firearm Ownership (HFR), Median Household Income, to see if there is a relationship between them and police kills. Hopefully if we understand the relationship between police kills and socioeconomic predictors it might inform us on how to constructively deal with this issue. We used RStudio and RMarkdown to do our project, because it is the best choice for regression analysis.
